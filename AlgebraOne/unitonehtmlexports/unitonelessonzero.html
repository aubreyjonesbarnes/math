		<div>Defining Sets 

A set is a group of "things" (objects or ideas). 

</div>
		<div>RULE
</div>
		<div>Unit 1 Lesson 1.0
Set of Numbers</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>A set is a group of "things" (objects or ideas). 

A set could include the players on the football or soccer teams. There are two sets pictured here:  one is a set of 16 boys on the soccer team, 
</div>
		<div>and the other is a set of 20 boys on a football team. 
</div>
		<div>We often identify sets with letters. These two sets could be Set A and Set B.  

</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set.
</div>
		<div>Members of a set</div>
		<div>Finite and Infinite Sets


Those things which belong to the set are called elements or members of the set. Each boy on the soccer team is a member of that set. Similarly, each boy on the football team is a member of that set. 

                      
     
</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set. If its members or elements are unlimited, it is an infinite set. These teams are finite sets because they have a limited number of members.
 
</div>
		<div>Members of finite sets:

A limited number - they can be counted.
</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set.
</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set. If its members or elements are unlimited, it is an infinite set. 
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25DONE</div>
		<div>Because we can't count all the stars in the sky, it is an infinite set.
</div>
		<div>Because there are only 5 apples in this basket; it is also a finite set. 
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>Examples:
1.  Set A is the set of counting numbers less than 6:A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} numbers. 
</div>
		<div>In Algebra, brackets {  } contain members of a set.
</div>
		<div>Since this set ends, its elements can be counted. 
</div>
		<div>In algebra, we talk about sets of numbers. 
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>B = [All grains of sand at Malibu Beach}</div>
		<div>2. Set B is the set of all grains of sand at Malibu Beach:


</div>
		<div>Once "Malibu Beach" is defined, this set also has a "last grain of sand," or an end.
</div>
		<div>Given enough time, every grain of sand could be counted, so Set B is a finite set.</div>
		<div>B = {All grains of sand at Malibu Beach}
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25DONE</div>
		<div>The Set of Natural Numbers

3. Set N is the set of natural numbers, or counting 

    numbers:

                                      N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}
</div>
		<div>Since set N is endless (the three dots indicate that it continues forever in the same order), its members cannot all be counted. Therefore, set N is an infinite set like the starry sky.
</div>
		<div>This finite set is called the empty set, or the null set. It is written as E = {   } or E = ∅. The symbol for the null set is ∅. </div>
		<div>The Null or Empty Set

4. Suppose we define Set E as the set of natural 
    numbers between 4 and 5.
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 4
</div>
		<div>We write it like this:

Set E = {Natural numbers between 4 and 5}</div>
		<div>Because there are no Natural Numbers between 4   
and 5, set E has no members.
</div>
		<div>(We could have chosen any name for the set.)</div>
		<div>We write it like this:

Set E = {Natural numbers between 4 and 5}</div>
		<div>finite
</div>
		<div>∅
</div>
		<div>infinite
</div>
		<div>Tell if the set is finite or infinite. If the set is the null set, use the symbol "∅".

Set E = {All the even counting numbers}
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE A
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>A finite set is one with a limited number of elements that can be counted. Set E cannot be counted because it has no end.
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>Let's look at the set of soccer players again.
</div>
		<div>Notice that every member of set B (players #10, #1, and #23) is also a member of set A. We call set B a subset of set A because every member of set B is in set A.

</div>
		<div>Set A
</div>
		<div>Notice that every member of set B (players #10, #1, and #23) is also a member of set A. 
</div>
		<div>The symbol ⊆ means "is a subset of."</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25DONE</div>
		<div>Set B
</div>
		<div>Three of the players are subs on the team.
</div>
		<div>We'll call this team set A.

</div>
		<div>We’ll choose these three players from set A and call them set B.
</div>
		<div>It is written like this: B ⊆ A which reads: “Set B is a subset of set A.”
</div>
		<div>We call set B a subset of set A because every member of set B is in set A. </div>
		<div> They are also still in set A.
</div>
		<div>Notice that every member of set B (players #10, #1, and #23) is also a member of set A. We call set B a subset of set A because every member of set B is in set A. It is written like this: B     A which reads "Set B is a subset of set A." 

</div>
		<div>Disjoint sets have no elements in common. Let's define set A as the members on the soccer team,

</div>
		<div>Set A

</div>
		<div>Disjoint sets have no elements in common. 

</div>
		<div>Disjoint Sets

</div>
		<div>Let's say that no one plays on both teams, so they have no members in common. These are called two disjoint sets. No member or element of set A belongs to set B and no element or member of set B belongs to set A.

</div>
		<div>Disjoint sets have no elements in common. Let's define set A as the members on the soccer team, and set B as members on the football team.

</div>
		<div>Let's say that no one plays on both teams, so they have no members in common. These are called two disjoint sets.

</div>
		<div>Universal Sets

</div>
		<div>The universe or universal set is the overall set from which all subsets are taken.

</div>
		<div>The universe or universal set is the overall set from which all subsets are taken. If in a problem we define the universal set as the set of all natural numbers, then it is this set that we can choose our answers from (or get subsets from). So if we are given the set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} as our universal set, then our problems and answers will come from this set. Here are some examples of sets, subsets, and disjoint sets of numbers using 
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} as our universal set.

</div>
		<div>Here are some examples of sets, subsets, and disjoint sets of numbers using 
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} as our universal set. 

Examples:
Given:   the universal set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
</div>
		<div>
Set B is an infinite set because it includes all odd numbers. Since there is no end to odd numbers, they are unlimited (the three dots . . . means it goes forever). 
</div>
		<div>Set C = {2, 4, 6, . . .}

                 
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE
</div>
		<div>
                Set A = {5, 11, 17},
</div>
		<div>
             Set A = {5, 11, 17},
</div>
		<div>Set A is a finite set with 3 members or elements. The elements are 5, 11, and 17. 

                 
</div>
		<div>
Set C is also an infinite set because it includes all even numbers (an unlimited amount). 
</div>
		<div>3.  B is a subset of N.     

</div>
		<div>• Each element of C is also 
found in N.
</div>
		<div>• Each element of C is also 
 found in N.
</div>
		<div>• Each element of A is also 
 found in N.
</div>
		<div>• Each element of B is also 
 found in N.
</div>
		<div>Note: In these examples, the set of natural numbers, N, may be specified as the universal set for sets A, B, and C.

                 
</div>
		<div>4.  C is a subset of N.

</div>
		<div>1.  A is a subset of B.          

</div>
		<div>Given:      the universal set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
                Set A = {5, 11, 17},
                Set B = {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .},
                Set C = {2, 4, 6, . . .}

Consider the relationships between these three sets:
                 
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25DONE</div>
		<div>• B and C have no elements that are the same.
</div>
		<div>• Each element of A is also 
 found in B.
</div>
		<div>2.  A is a subset of N.        

</div>
		<div>• Each element of C is also 
ound in N.
</div>
		<div>5.  B and C are disjoint sets.

</div>
		<div>C is a subset of A
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE D
</div>
		<div>A is a subset of C
</div>
		<div>A and C</div>
		<div>A and C are disjoint sets
</div>
		<div>Given: 
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {6, 7, 8}, C = {1, 3, 5, . . .}, 
and N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, 
express a relationship between:</div>
		<div>Have a soda!
</div>
		<div>Remember that disjoint sets have no elements in common. Sets A and C have elements in common, 
so they are not disjoint sets.
</div>
		<div>Because C is infinite and A is finite,  C is not a subset of A.
</div>
		<div>B and N are disjoint sets
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE E
</div>
		<div>Given: 
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {6, 7, 8}, C = {1, 3, 5, . . .}, and 
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, express a relationship between:

B and N
</div>
		<div>B is a subset of N
</div>
		<div>N is a subset of B
</div>
		<div>
Because N is infinite and B is finite,  N is not a subset of B.
</div>
		<div>B is a subset of A
</div>
		<div>Given: 
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {6, 7, 8}, C = {1, 3, 5, . . .}, and 
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, express a relationship between:

A and B
</div>
		<div>A is a subset of B
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE F
</div>
		<div>A and B are disjoint sets
</div>
		<div>If A was a subset of B then all of the 
elements of set A would also be members of 
set B. Since this is not true, A is not a subset of B.
</div>
		<div>If B was a subset of A then all of the elements 
of set B would also be members of set A. 
Since this is not true, B is not a subset of A.

		<div>Sets of Numbers

There are many sets of numbers that will be used in algebra:

		<div>Natural Numbers: N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}      
• Counting Numbers
</div>
		<div>
Rational Numbers: Q = { – , a and b integers, b  ≠ 0}• Common Fractions

• Natural Numbers, plus 0
</div>
		<div>
Integers: Z = {. . .-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} • Whole Numbers, plus opposites for each 
natural number plus 0</div>

		<div>Irrational Numbers: I = {Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals} 
</div>
		<div>Real Numbers: R = {All rational or irrational numbers}

		<div>In Algebra, we talk about sets of numbers. 
</div>
		<div>(It has exactly 5 elements.) 
</div>
		<div>Examples:
1.  Set A is the set of counting numbers less than 6:
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} numbers. </div>
		<div>This makes it a finite set.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B
</div>
		<div>Tell if the set is finite or infinite. If the set is the null set, use the symbol "∅".

Set A = {All pink elephants in your classroom}
</div>
		<div>An infinite set is one with an unlimited 
number of elements. You probably don’t have 
any pink elephants in your classroom!
</div>
		<div>A finite set is one with an limited number of elements 
that can be counted. You probably don’t have any pink elephants in your classroom that can be counted!
</div>
		<div>Tell if the set is finite or infinite. If the set is the null set, use the symbol "∅".

Set A = {All stars visible to you on a single clear night.}
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE C
</div>
		<div>An infinite set is one that cannot be counted. You could count all of the stars visible to you on a clear night. 
</div>
		<div>The null set, or empty set, is one that has no members. 
There are many stars in the sky on a clear night, 
so Set S is not an empty set.
