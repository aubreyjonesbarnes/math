		<div>Play</div>
		<div>Algebra and Basketball
Both basketball and algebra have a special language.
</div>
		<div>This is a slam dunk.  No matter how flashy it is, it is only worth two points.
</div>
		<div>This is a foul shot, and it's worth one point.
</div>
		<div>A shot made from outside the three-point line is worth three points.
</div>

		<div>Just like basketball, you'll enjoy algebra more if you learn the language.
</div>
		<div>Knowing algebra terms will help make you a winner.</div>

		<div>Algebraic Expressions
Let's compare an algebraic expression to a winning game with the Cougars!
</div>
		<div>We will compare the algebraic expression inside the flag to the points scored in the winning game.

</div>
		<div>But first let's look at some definitions.</div>
		<div>An algebraic expression is a number or letter by itself or numbers or letters that are connected by symbols indicating mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.</div>
		<div>RULE
</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + z</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + z</div>
		<div>A coefficient is the multiplier of the variable. </div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Terms

A variable is a letter in an expression that can be replaced with a number.

</div>
		<div>It is a constant number because it does not change.</div>
		<div>5x - 8y + 3z =</div>
		<div>(5 • x) - (8 • y) + (3 • z) =</div>
		<div>5x - 8y + 3z</div>
		<div>A term can be a product (when two numbers are multiplied). . .</div>
		<div>Terms

A term is the letter(s) or number(s) in an algebraic expression. . .


</div>
		<div>5x - 8y + 3z</div>
		<div>. . . which are linked by operations such as addition or subtraction.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>. . . or a quotient (when two numbers are divided).</div>
		<div>(x ÷ 5) + (y ÷ 4) + (z ÷ 3) =</div>
		<div>For example, the coefficients in this equation are 5, -8, and 3.</div>
		<div>Remember the 5x, -8y, and 3z are terms in the following algebraic expression.</div>
		<div>Always include the negative sign of a negative coefficient with the term. </div>
		<div>Terms are the letter/number pairs in an algebraic expression.</div>
		<div>5x - 8y + 3z =</div>
		<div>The coefficient is an expression in any multiplier of a variable (that is, any number being multiplied by a variable).</div>
		<div>value of three
point
shots
</div>
		<div>In this algebraic expression, x is the number of 3 pointers, y is the number of 2 pointers, and z is the number of 1 pointers.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>coefficients3x + 2y + 1z
</div>
		<div>It is a known number and does not change. </div>
		<div>3x + 2y + 1z</div>
		<div>A three-point shot is always worth three points.
</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + 1z</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>A two-point shot is always worth two points. 
</div>
		<div>The 2 in this expression is also a coefficient.
 
</div>
		<div>That never changes. Because it never changes and is being multiplied by a number that will change (x,) it is a coefficient.</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + 1z</div>
		<div>A foul shot is always worth one point. 
</div>
		<div>The 1 is a coefficient.   </div>
		<div>In this case, the coefficient is the same as the value of the shot.</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + 1z</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + z</div>
		<div>Different numbers could replace the variable to make different equations.</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE
</div>
		<div>A variable is a letter in an expression that can be replaced with a number. </div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>The reason it is called a variable is that it can vary, or change.</div>
		<div>Variables</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Coefficient</div>
		<div>We always include the negative sign (if there is one) as part of the coefficient. </div>
		<div>5x + 4y - 3z</div>
		<div>So -3 is the coefficient of z. </div>
		<div>A coefficient is any multiplier of a variable. </div>
		<div>In our game, the variable will represent how many of each type of shot was made.</div>
		<div>Official RecordName            3 pt shot     2 pt shot     1 pt shotSmith
Gong
Jones 
Sanchez
Brown
Anderson
Ramirez
Sowards
Thompson
</div>
		<div>A different number of shots might be made by each player, which would make up the different variables.</div>
		<div>For example, Smith might make six 3-point shots and Brown might make 8.</div>
		<div>We could have included a 1 in front of the z, but this isn't necessary since a number (z) multiplied by 1 is still the number (z). For example, 1• 6 = 6, 4• 1 = 4, etc.
</div>
		<div>x = number of 3 point shots
y = number of 2 point shots
z = number of 3 point shots
</div>
		<div> 3x + 2y + z = final score
</div>
		<div>At the beginning of the game, no one knows how many of each shot will be made.</div>
		<div>For now we show the unknown number by putting in a variable, because it can vary.</div>

                                4x - 10y + 2</div>
		<div>A term is a letter or number in an algebraic expression.
A term can be a product.  Try again.
</div>
		<div>No
</div>
		<div>Yes</div>
		<div>Is this an algebraic expression? Why or why not?

                                4x - 10y + 2</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B4
</div>
		<div>An algebraic expression has numbers or letters 
connected by symbols indicating mathematical operations.
</div>
		<div>This is an algebraic expression because 
it has numbers or letters connected by symbols 
indicating mathematical operations.
</div>
		<div>This algebraic expression tells the coach what the final game score will be.

 3x + 2y + z = final score    
</div>
		<div>At the end of the game, the scorekeeper has a record of how many of each type of shot was made. This tells us the final score because every shot made will be worth either 3 points, 2 points or 1 point.         </div>
		<div> 3x + 2y + z = final score    
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>• Simplify by multiplying</div>
		<div>by replacing variables</div>
		<div>Now the coach can find the final score of the game


          3x + 2y + z =   
</div>
		<div>21    +   50   +   23   =  94</div>
		<div>with the number of shots made.</div>
		<div>• Assign numbers to variables</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>3x + 2y + z = 
</div>
		<div>3(7) + 2(25) + 1(23) = 94</div>
		<div>There were seven 3-point shots, twenty-five 2-point shots, and twenty-three 1-point shots scored. This equation tells us there were 94 points scored in total. Twenty-one points were from 3-point shots, fifty points were from 2-point shots, and twenty-three points were made from 1-point shots.</div>
		<div>Help Hector Jones find the number of points he made. Simplify a numeric expression by predicting what each next step will be. Use the given numbers in place of the variables.</div>
		<div>This process of replacing the variables with numbers works the same way in a math class as it did on the basketball court.

</div>
		<div>for the answer.</div>
		<div>From the score sheet he scored 2</div>
		<div>Try this yourself and then continue on </div>
		<div>Help Hector find the number of points he made.

</div>
		<div>one-pointer.</div>
		<div>How will he simplify the expression?</div>
		<div>three-pointers, 3 two pointers, and 1</div>
		<div>What will he put for x, y, and z?</div>
		<div>6 + 6 + 1 =</div>
		<div>3 (2) + 2 (3) + 1 (1) =</div>
		<div>13 points</div>
		<div>x = 2;  y = 3;  z = 1</div>
		<div>Evaluate:

</div>
		<div>12 + 1 =</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Hector made sure he followed the Order of Operations. 
He did all the multiplication before the addition.
</div>
		<div>The coach visits the crystal ball once again to find out how the Cougars will do at their next game.

</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>a = 5  b = 20  c = 2</div>
		<div>= 57</div>
		<div>15 + 40 + 2</div>
		<div>This time, the coach can figure out the score.  Can you?

</div>
		<div>Evaluate:</div>
		<div>3(5) + 2(20) + 1(2)</div>
		<div>3a + 2b + c</div>
		<div>But what will the
other team's score
be?
</div>
		<div>CONCLUSION
</div>
		<div>Ahhhh.....
To answer that 
question you'll need more than algebra.
