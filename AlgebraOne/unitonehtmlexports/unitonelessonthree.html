		<div>Begin!</div>
		<div>The Commutative and Associative
 Properties
</div>
		<div>Could you solve this problem easily in your head, without the use of a calculator?</div>
		<div>Unit 1 Lesson 1.3
The Commutative and Associative Properties</div>
		<div>In this lesson, you will learn that you can sometimes rearrange numbers to make them easier to work with.</div>
		<div>Making Problems Easier</div>
		<div>51 + 14 + 49 + 6 = </div>
		<div>What if you arrange the sequence of numbers? Is it easier then?</div>
		<div>120 </div>
		<div>20 + 100 = </div>
		<div>(14 + 6) + (49 + 51) = </div>
		<div>49 + 14 + 51 + 6 = </div>
		<div>The Commutative Property is easy to understand. </div>
		<div>We can learn how it works at Regina’s birthday party.

Regina is preparing for her birthday party while she is at school.
</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property and
Regina's Birthday Party
</div>
		<div>It simply means that it doesn’t matter what order we add two numbers. The answer is the same. 

</div>
		<div>Johnny, Mike, and Ben are together in the hall at school when Regina passes out invitations for her party.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Later, Regina finds Sally and Jennifer at school and gives them their invitations.</div>
		<div>At the end of the day, Regina has invited five people from school.</div>
		<div>On the day of her birthday, Regina greets her guests at the door at home.</div>
		<div>Regina first greets Sally and Jennifer at her home.</div>
		<div>Soon after, Johnny, Mike, and Ben arrive at the party at her home.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Five people have come to Regina's party at her home.</div>
		<div>Regina talked to five people at school and five people at her party at home.</div>
		<div>At school, Regina first talked to three people...</div>
		<div>At school, Regina first talked to three people and then to two people.</div>
		<div>And then to three people.</div>
		<div>At her party, Regina first talked to two people...</div>

		<div>2 + 3 = 3 + 2</div>
		<div>Your equation should look something like this:</div>
		<div>5 = 5</div>
		<div>At school and at home, she talked to five people.


Can you write an equation that describes the order in which Regina spoke to her friends at school and at home?
</div>
		<div>2 + 3 = 3 + 2</div>
		<div>3      +      2      =      2      +      3
</div>
		<div>This is an example of the Commutative Property of Addition.

x      +      y      =      y      +      x
</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Addition
</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>This is another reason we use variables in a sentence. 

</div>
		<div>x + y = y + x</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Addition says it doesn't matter what order we add the two numbers, the answer will be the same.

</div>
		<div>Another way to say it is: for all numbers x and y,</div>
		<div>The sentence illustrates the general statement that the Commutative Property works for all numbers.</div>
		<div>-1980 + 506 = 506 + -1980
</div>
		<div>Not Sure
</div>
		<div>Which of these equations demonstrates the Commutative Property of Addition?
</div>
		<div>QUESTION 1
</div>
		<div>-1980 + 506 = -1980 + 506
</div>
		<div>This equation does not demonstrate a 
change in the order of numbers.  
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>Review</div>
		<div>Looks like you need a little review.
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>We can find out how it works as Regina and Jen serve cookies at the party.</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Multiplication

The Commutative Property of Multiplication is much like the Commutative Property of Addition. 
</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Multiplication is much like the Commutative Property of Addition. It means that you can multiply two numbers in any order and get the same answer.</div>
		<div>RULE 2
</div>
		<div>Then the friends gave the cookies back to Regina and Jen. (There is still a total of 8 cookies.)</div>
		<div>First Regina and Jen gave the cookies to their friends (8 total). </div>
		<div>When the guests discovered the baker had forgotten the sugar, they gave the cookies back.</div>
		<div>Both of them gave one cookie to each guest - so each guest had two cookies, one from Regina and one from Jen.
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Both times, eight cookies were exchanged.  </div>
		<div>2     •      4      =      4     •      2</div>
		<div>We can write an equation that describes this event. 

The equation should look like this:
</div>
		<div>The equation should look like this:</div>
		<div>Example:
The Commutative Property of Multiplication 
says that if you can multiply two numbers in any order, the answers will be the same.
</div>
		<div>2  •  4 = 4  •  2</div>
		<div>x  •  y = y  •  x</div>
		<div>2  •  y = y  •  2</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Multiplication

Another way to say this: The Commutative Property of Multiplication states that for all numbers x and y,
</div>
		<div>Example:The Commutative Property of Multiplication 
says that if you can multiply two numbers in any order, the answers will be the same.

</div>
		<div>8    =    8</div>
		<div>9 + 4 =4 + 9
</div>
		<div>9 • 4 = 36</div>
		<div>9 • 4 = 4 • 9</div>
		<div>QUESTION 2
</div>
		<div>9 • 4 = 9 • 4</div>
		<div>Choose an example of the Commutative Property of Multiplication.</div>
		<div>This equation does not demonstrate 
a change in the order of numbers. 
</div>
		<div>We are looking for the Commutative Property 
of Multiplication, not addition.
</div>
		<div>7 + 2 = 4 + 5</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Addition

The Associative Property of Addition states that it doesn't matter which two numbers are added first in problems like those shown here:

</div>
		<div>Adding y and z first</div>
		<div>Adding x and y first</div>
		<div>For example:

(4 + 3) + 2 = 4 + (3 + 2)
</div>
		<div>RULE 3
</div>
		<div>9 = 9</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Addition states that it doesn't matter which two numbers are added first in problems like those shown here:

For all numbers x, y, and z:

(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
</div>
		<div>This states that it doesn't matter in which order the numbers are added - the answers are the same.

</div>
		<div>(4 + 3) + 2 = 4 + (3 + 2)
7 + 2 = 4 + 5
9 = 9
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>For Example:</div>
		<div>Can you think of another way to say this?</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>+ chips</div>
		<div>then he added nuts.</div>
		<div>For his second batch, he added chocolate chips first.</div>
		<div>(nuts + dough)</div>
		<div>For his first batch, he added nuts to the dough.</div>
		<div> + nuts</div>
		<div>(chips + dough) </div>
		<div>then he added chocolate chips.</div>
		<div>The day before Regina's birthday, the baker of the sugarless cookies had prepared the dough. He divided it into two equal parts.</div>
		<div>This batch was made by mixing the nuts into the dough first and then adding the chips. [made with (nuts + dough) + chips]</div>
		<div>nuts + (dough + chips)</div>
		<div>This batch was made by mixing the chips into the dough first and then adding nuts. [made with (chips + dough) + nuts]</div>
		<div>(nuts + dough) + chips</div>
		<div>Even though the baker followed a different sequence each time, both recipes were the same and both resulted in the same number of cookies with the ready-to-bake cookie dough.</div>
		<div>(adding the nuts 
to the dough first)

</div>
		<div>(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)</div>
		<div>(nuts + dough) + chips = nuts + (dough + chips)</div>
		<div>(adding the chips 
to the dough first)

</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Addition says that for all numbers x, y, and z,</div>
		<div>An equation could look like this:</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>(4 + 3) + 2 = 4 + (3 + 2)</div>
		<div>9 = 9</div>
		<div>7 + 2 = 4 + 5</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>In other words, it doesn't matter which two numbers you add first. The answer will be the same.

</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Addition says you can change the order in which you add numbers.
</div>
		<div>6 + (7 + 8)</div>
		<div>(7 + 8) + 6 =</div>
		<div>QUESTION 3
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Which answer illustrates the Associative Property of Addition?</div>
		<div>(7 + 6) + 8</div>
		<div>7 + (8 + 6)</div>
		<div>(8 + 7) + 6</div>
		<div>Remember that the Associative Property of Addition says you can change the order in which you add numbers. That does not mean that you should switch the order that the 
numbers are written in.
</div>
		<div>For all numbers x, y, and z:</div>
		<div>RULE 4
</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Multiplication</div>
		<div>The result will be the same. Here is the general form:

</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Multiplication says it doesn't matter which two numbers you multiply first when multiplying several numbers together.
</div>
		<div>(x • y) • z = x • (y • z)</div>
		<div>Knowing the definition of the Associative Property of Addition should make it easy to define the Associative Property of Multiplication.</div>
		<div>4 rows</div>
		<div>Suppose the baker puts the chocolate chip cookie dough on 2 cookie sheets like this:</div>
		<div>(3 columns • 4 rows) • 2 sheets = 24 cookies</div>
		<div>3 columns</div>
		<div>On each sheet there are 3 columns and 4 rows.</div>
		<div>3 sheets</div>
		<div>2 rows</div>
		<div>Because we have kept the same 3 numbers (2, 3, and 4) the arrangement on the cookie sheets does not matter - we still have the same number of cookies.</div>
		<div>Then he puts the vanilla cookie dough on 3 cookie sheets, like this:</div>
		<div>4 columns</div>
		<div>Instead of 2 sheets, there are now 3 sheets. Instead of 4 rows per sheet, there are now only 2. Instead of 3 columns per sheet, there are now 4. </div>
		<div>2 sheets</div>
		<div>(3 • 4) • 2  =  4 • (2 • 3)</div>
		<div>4 rows</div>
		<div>(3 columns • 4 rows) • 2 sheets = 4 columns • (2 rows • 3 sheets)</div>
		<div>3 columns</div>
		<div>3 sheets</div>
		<div>Both times, the baker made 24 cookies.</div>
		<div>2 rows</div>
		<div>24  =  24</div>

		<div>The Associative Property of Multiplication says you can change the order in which you multiply numbers. 

</div>
		<div>(4 • 2) • 8 = 4 • (2 • 8)</div>
		<div>In other words, it doesn't matter which two you multiply first. The answer will be the same. </div>
		<div>8 • 8 = 4 • 16</div>
		<div>Let's look at the baker's cookie sheets again.

</div>

		<div>12 • 2 = 3 • 8</div>
		<div>(3 columns • 4 rows) • 2 sheets = 3 sheets • (4 columns • 2 rows)</div>
		<div>12 • 2 = 3 • 8</div>
		<div>24 = 24</div>
		<div>QUESTION 4
