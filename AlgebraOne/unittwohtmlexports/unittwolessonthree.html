		<div>Val and Sal's Graduation</div>
		<div>Val</div>
		<div>By March it looked like the valedictorian of the senior class was going to be Val and the salutatorian was going to be Sal. 

</div>
		<div>  
<</div>
		<div>

></div>
		<div>#1</div>
		<div>#2</div>
		<div>I'm first, you're second.</div>
		<div>The valedictorian is the person who is number one 
in the graduating class and the salutatorian is the number two person. Usually both of them give speeches at graduation time.
</div>
		<div>Just wait. In May, I'll be first.</div>
		<div>They both continued to study until the end of the year.
</div>
		<div>Sal worked a little harder than Val and got better grades. By May graduation, the valedictorian was Sal and the salutatorian was Val. The order had changed.
</div>
		<div>This lesson shows how properties of addition (the Commutative and Associative Properties), work with integers (which includes negative numbers as well positives).

Here is our first one. For all numbers x and y:
</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Addition
</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>x + y = y + x</div>
		<div>This is called the Commutative Property of Addition.
this property defines that the answer will be the same no matter the order in which the two numbers are added.This property is always true, including the addition of integers.</div>
		<div>Here is our first one. For all numbers x and y:
</div>
		<div>The Commutative Property of Addition can look like this:</div>
		<div>This is called the Commutative Property of Addition. 
this property defines that the answer will be the same no matter the order in which the two numbers are added.This property is always true, including the addition of integers.
</div>
		<div>5 + (-3) = -3 + 5</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>2 = 2</div>
		<div>RULE 2
</div>
		<div>I don't 
like this 
grouping. 

We must 
change it.
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>Even when we change the order of the birds, their number is still the same.
</div>
		<div>For all numbers x, y, and z:</div>
		<div>x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z</div>
		<div>The Associative Property of Addition
</div>
		<div>This is known as the Associative Property of Addition.</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>This is known as the Associative Property of Addition. The Commutative Property of Addition rules that it doesn't matter in which order two numbers are added while the Associative Property says it doesn’t matter which two are added first when we have more than two numbers.</div>
		<div>x      +     (y + z)         =         (x + y)        +     z</div>
		<div>Using the Associative Property of Addition we can work with negative numbers. Watch how the groupings can change because of this property:
</div>
		<div>[3 + (-7)] + 5 = 3 + [(-7) + 5]
</div>
		<div>-4 + 5 = 3 + (-2)</div>
		<div>Answers are the same.</div>
		<div>[3 + (-7)] + 5 = 3 + [(-7) + 5]
</div>
		<div>1 = 1</div>
		<div>If you have $35 and spend $4, you will have $31 left:
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>RULE 3
</div>
		<div>$35 + (-$4) = $31</div>
		<div>$35 - $4 = $31</div>
		<div>$35 + $0 = $35</div>
		<div>If you have $35 and spend no money you will have
</div>
		<div>When you add 0 to a number, the value of the number is kept. We say zero keeps the identity. </div>
		<div>$35 + $0 = $35</div>
		<div>It is the same as when you look in the mirror. You see yourself - nothing added or subtracted. Your identity is the same.
</div>
		<div>Does 2 + 0 = 2?
</div>
		<div>Yes! Zero added to any number is the number itself. This is called the Additive Identity.
</div>
		<div>Does 0 + 4 = 4?
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>0 + x = x
</div>
		<div>and</div>
		<div>The Additive Identity Property states that for any number x,
</div>
		<div>x + 0 = x
</div>
		<div>3 + 0 = 3
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>For example:
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 4
</div>
		<div>-5 + 0 = -5
</div>
		<div>0 + (-7) = -7
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 5
</div>
		<div>RULE 4
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>If you start with $35 and you buy a T-shirt for $35,
</div>
		<div>$35 - $35 = 0

(-$35 is the opposite of $35.)
</div>
		<div>Additive Inverses
</div>
		<div>For any number (x), the symbol "-x" means the opposite of "x," or the additive inverse of x.
</div>
		<div>In other words, the Additive Inverse Property states that the sum of any number and its opposite is 0. For any number x,
</div>
		<div>$35 + (-$35) = 0</div>
		<div>x + (-x) = 0
</div>
		<div>• The opposite of 6 is -6.
</div>
		<div>x = 6
</div>
		<div>-x = -6
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 6
</div>
		<div>-x = -(-5)
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 7
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>-x = 5
</div>
		<div>• The opposite of -5 is 5.
</div>
		<div>-x = -(-5)
</div>
		<div>x = -5
</div>
		<div>• The opposite of -13 is 13.
</div>
		<div>x = -13
</div>
		<div>-x = -(-13)
</div>
		<div>-x = 13
</div>
		<div>-x = -(-13)
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 8
</div>
		<div>6 + (-6) = 0
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 9
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 10
</div>
		<div>-9 + 9 = 0
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 11
</div>
		<div>2 + (-2) = 0

		<div>If two numbers added together equal zero, 
they are additive
inverses (or opposites)
of each other.
