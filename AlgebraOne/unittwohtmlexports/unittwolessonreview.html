		<div>A set is a group of "things" (objects or ideas). 

A set may include the players on the football or soccer teams. There are two sets pictured here:  one is a set of 16 boys on the soccer team; 
</div>
		<div>The other is a set of 20 boys on a football team. 
</div>
		<div>We often identify sets with letters. These two sets could be Set A and Set B.  

</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set.
</div>
		<div>Members of a set</div>
		<div>Finite and Infinite Sets


Those things which belong to the set are called elements or members of the set. Each boy on the soccer team is a member of that set. Similarly, each boy on the football team is a member of that set. 

                      
     
</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set. If its members or elements are unlimited, it is an infinite set. These teams are finite sets because they have a limited number of members.
 
</div>
		<div>Members of finite sets:

A limited number - they can be counted.
</div>
		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set.

		<div>If a set has a limited number of members or elements, it is a finite set. If its members or elements are unlimited, it is an infinite set.

		<div>Let's say that no one plays on both teams, so they have no members in common. These are called two disjoint sets. No member or element of set A belongs to set B and no element or member of set B belongs to set A.

</div>
		<div>Disjoint sets have no elements in common. Let's define set A as the members on the soccer team and set B as members on the football team.

		<div>Sets of Numbers

There are many sets of numbers that will be used in algebra:
</div>
		<div>Naturals: N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}      
• Counting numbers
</div>
		<div>
Rationals: Q = { – , a and b integers, b  ≠ 0}• Common Fractions 

</div>
		<div>Wholes: W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}   

• Naturals, plus 0
</div>
		<div>
Integers: Z = {. . .-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} • Wholes, plus opposites for each natural.plus 0
</div>
		<div>Irrationals: I = {Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals} 
</div>
		<div>Reals: R = {All rational or irrational numbers}
</div>
		<div>There are many sets of numbers that will be used in algebra:
</div>
		<div>Wholes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4,…}</div>
		<div>Integers {…., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}</div>

		<div>Rationals {  ,a and b integers, b = 0}</div>
		<div>Note: The rationals and irrationals are disjoint sets because they have no elements in common.
</div>
		<div>Irrationals
 {Non-Terminating, non-repeating, decimals}</div>
		<div>The following Venn diagram illustrates the relationship of the set of Real Numbers to its subsets:

		<div>• A term is a number by itself, a product with a letter 
  and a number (from a multiplication problem) or a 
  quotient (from a division problem).
</div>
		<div>Definitions:

• A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) in an 
  expression that can be replaced by a number or 
  other symbols. Can you identify the variable in this 
  expression?  2x + 3 = 11      The variable is x.
</div>
		<div>Can you identify the terms in this expression?  

2x + 3 = 11 
The terms are 2x, 3, and 11.

		<div>Properties:

The commutative, associative, and distributive properties help to combine like terms and simplify expressions.
</div>
		<div>For Addition:</div>
		<div>2 • 3 = 3 • 2</div>
		<div>2 + 3 = 3 + 2</div>
		<div>For Multiplication:</div>
		<div>ab = ba</div>
		<div>a + b = b + a</div>
		<div>Commutative Property</div>
		<div>A
</div>
		<div>1
</div>
		<div>(2)(3 + 4) = 2 • 3 + 2 • 4</div>
		<div>(a)(b + c) = ab + ac</div>
		<div>Distributive Property of Multiplication Over Addition: Here both the b and c are multiplied by the a. Remember the chocolate factory from Unit 1?</div>
		<div>3y</div>
		<div>Like terms are terms in an expression that have exactly the same variables in them or that have no variables at all.
</div>
		<div>2x</div>

		<div>truck         +        car          +        truck</div>

</div>
		<div>The terms 2x and 5x are like terms because in these terms, one factor is a number and the other factor is x.</div>
		<div>Can you find the like terms in the following algebraic expression?</div>
		<div>5x</div>
		<div>2x + 3y + 5x</div>

		<div>The terms 32, 75, and 5 are 
like terms because none of these terms have variables in them.

		<div>Formulas in Algebra</div>
		<div>So instead of writing long sentences with words, we write a very shortened version using an algebraic expression.  

</div>
		<div>Here is an example:

Instead of saying "To determine the distance around a rectangle, we add the two lengths and the two widths of the rectangle together," we would write the formula for the distance around a rectangle as this:

</div>
		<div>2 lengths</div>
		<div>2 widths</div>
		<div>2L + 2W  

where L is a measure of the length and W is a measure of the width.

		<div>We know that the formula for the area of a rectangle or square is length x width. Because we know that all sides of a square are equal, the area of a square is:

		<div>Disjoint Sets

</div>
		<div>Disjoint sets have no elements in common. 

</div>
		<div> They are also still in set A.
</div>
		<div>Let's look at the set of soccer players again.
</div>
		<div>Set A
</div>
		<div>Set B
</div>
		<div>Three of the players are subs on the team.
</div>
		<div>We'll call this team set A.

</div>
		<div>We’ll choose these three players from set A and call them set B.
</div>
		<div>It is written as E = { } or E = Ø.
</div>
		<div>The Null or Empty Set

Suppose we define Set E as the set of natural numbers between 4 and 5:

E = {Natural Numbers between 4 and 5}
</div>
		<div>(The symbol for the null set is Ø.)</div>
		<div>This finite set is called the empty set, or the null set. 
</div>
		<div>Because there are no Natural Numbers between 4 and 5, set E has no members. 

</div>
		<div>(2 • 3)(4) = (2)(3 • 4)
</div>
		<div>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
</div>
		<div>(ab)(c) = (a)(bc)
</div>
		<div>Associative Property</div>
		<div>(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)
</div>
		<div>There are no like terms here.
</div>
		<div>6x + 7xy + 2z + y + 1
</div>
		<div>Like terms are terms in an expression that have exactly the same variables in them or that have no variables at all. Can you find the like terms in the following algebraic expression?
</div>
		<div>Formulas are used in Algebra to express ways to solve problems using Algebraic expressions.  So instead of writing long verbal expressions, we write a very shortened version using an algebraic expression.

</div>
		<div>1L+ 1L =

</div>
		<div>1W + 1W = 
(1+1)W =
