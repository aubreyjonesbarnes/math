		<div>Begin!</div>
		<div>INTRODUCTION
</div>
		<div>Solving Problems in the Real World
</div>
		<div>(and some not so real.)</div>
		<div>Mathematics is a tool you can use to solve real world problems.
</div>
		<div>...but what are we
 going to use it for?</div>
		<div>You can use many different strategies. It depends on what type of problem you are solving.
</div>
		<div>(1) Determine which number to represent by a        
      variable.
</div>
		<div>(5) Check the solution.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15DONE</div>
		<div>(2) Represent the other number in terms of that 
      variable.
</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>Problem Solving Sets

To solve word problems that express one number in terms of another number, follow these steps:
</div>
		<div>(4) Solve the equation.</div>
		<div>(3) Write an equation that shows the relationship 
      between the two numbers represented in Step 2.
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>A Problem in Salaries

Jenny’s salary is 4 times Kim’s salary. Together they earn $825. Find the salary of each girl.
</div>
		<div>Since Jenny's salary is compared to Kim's, let the variable be Kim's salary.
</div>
		<div>• Divide by 5.</div>
		<div>Jenny + Kim = $825
</div>
		<div>• Represent the other 
  number in terms of the variable.
</div>
		<div>Let 4k = Jenny's salary
</div>
		<div>4k + k = 825
</div>
		<div>• Determine what the   
  variable represents.
</div>
		<div>Let k = Kim's salary
</div>
		<div>Since Jenny's salary is compared to Kim's, let the variable be Kim's salary.</div>
		<div>• Combine like terms.</div>
		<div>Jenny’s salary is 4 times Kim’s salary. Together they earn $825. Find the salary of each girl.</div>
		<div>• Write the equation.</div>
		<div>• Solve the equation.</div>
		<div>Jenny’s salary is 4 times Kim’s salary. Together they earn $825. Find the salary of each girl.</div>
		<div>k = 165</div>
		<div>5k = 825
</div>
		<div>Jenny’s salary is 4 times Kim’s salary. Together they earn $825. Find the salary of each girl.

</div>
		<div>Let k = Kim's salary</div>
		<div>Jenny’s salary is 4 times Kim’s salary. Together they earn $825. Find the salary of each girl.</div>
		<div>Kim's salary k = $165
Jenny's salary 4k = $660
</div>
		<div>Let 4k = Jenny's salary</div>
		<div>PRACTICE A
</div>
		<div>J + 2J = 12
</div>
		<div>J + 2C = 12</div>
		<div>Joaquin’s hourly wage is 2 times Carlos's hourly wage. Their hourly wages total $12. Find their hourly wages.

If Joaquin’s hourly wage = J and Carlos’s hourly wage = C then J = 2C. What is the equation we would use to solve this problem?
</div>
		<div>C + 2C = 12
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>Joaquin’s hourly wage is 2 times Carlos's hourly wage. Their hourly wages total $12.
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>Be careful as you determine the variable.
Joaquin's wage is 2 times Carlos's.
</div>
		<div>$524 is how much Nathan and Joe make together. Represent the variables, write the equation, then solve to determine their salaries.
</div>
		<div>Nathan's salary is 3 times Joe's.  Together they earn $524.  How much does each earn?
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15DONE</div>
		<div>Now, solve this equation:

Joaquin’s hourly wage is 2 times Carlos’s hourly wage. Their hourly wages total $12. Find their total wages.

C + 2C = 12
</div>
		<div>C = $3; J = $6 
</div>
		<div>C = $4; J = $12 
</div>
		<div>C = $4; J = $8 
</div>
		<div>Joaquin’s hourly wage is 2 times Carlos’s hourly wage. Their hourly wages total $12. 
Find their total wages.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE C
</div>
		<div>Troy's age is two more than 3 times Roger's age.  
The sum of their ages is 14. How old is each person?
</div>
		<div>You correctly figured Joe's salary. 
Nathan's salary is 3 times Joe's, not $524.
</div>
		<div>Troy is 9 yrs old and Roger is 5 yrs old
</div>
		<div>Troy is 11 yrs old and Roger is 3 yrs old
</div>
		<div>Troy is 2 yrs old and Roger is 9 yrs old
</div>
		<div>Troy is 9 yrs old and Roger is 2 yrs old
</div>
		<div>Troy's age is two more than 3 times Roger's age.  
The sum of their ages is 14. How old is each person?
</div>
		<div>• Determine what the 
  variable represents.
</div>
		<div>Since Rick’s age is comparable to Wendy’s, let the variable be Wendy’s age. Remember that "12 more than 5 times a number" means "reverse the order and multiply."
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>Let w = Wendy's age</div>
		<div>More Age Problems

Rick’s age is 12 more than 5 times Wendy’s age. The sum of their ages is 42. How old is each person?

</div>
		<div>• Write the equation.

</div>
		<div>w = 5
</div>
		<div>• Solve the equation.
</div>
		<div>6w + 12 = 42
</div>
		<div>6w + 12 - 12 = 42 - 12
</div>
		<div>• Add -12 to each side.
</div>
		<div>• Combine like terms.
</div>
		<div>• Represent the other 
  number in terms of that 
  variable.
</div>
		<div>w + (5w + 12) = 42
</div>
		<div>6w + 12 = 42
</div>
		<div>5w + 12 = Rick's age</div>
		<div>Rick’s age is 12 more than 5 times Wendy's age. The sum of their ages is 42. How old is each person?

</div>
		<div>Wendy + Rick = 42
</div>
		<div>6w = 30
</div>
		<div>• Divide by 6.</div>
		<div>Let 5w + 12 = Rick's age</div>
		<div>Wendy’s age w = 5</div>
		<div>Let w = Wendy's age</div>
		<div>Rick’s age is 12 more than 5 times Wendy's age. The sum of their ages is 42. How old is each person?

</div>
		<div>Rick’s age: 5w + 12 = 37</div>
		<div>You need to be more careful when you assign the variable. Follow the specifications exactly from 
the problem when you write the equation.
</div>
		<div>Number Problems

The second of three numbers is 3 times the first. The third number is 4 more than the second. Find the three numbers if their sum is 53.
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15DONE</div>
		<div>7x + 4 = 53
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 3 times the first. The third number is 4 more than the second. Find the three numbers if their sum is 53.

</div>
		<div>• Write the equation.
</div>
		<div>Let x = first number
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 3 times the first. The third number is 4 more than the second. Find the three numbers if their sum is 53.

</div>
		<div>x = 7</div>
		<div>7x = 49
</div>
		<div>first + second + third = 53
</div>
		<div>• Represent the other 
  numbers in terms of the 
  variable.
</div>
		<div>7x = 49
</div>
		<div>x + 3x + 3x + 4 = 53
</div>
		<div>Let 3x = second number
</div>
		<div>• Subtract 4 from each side.
</div>
		<div>• Divide.</div>
		<div>Let 3x + 4 = third number
</div>
		<div>x + 3x + 3x + 4 = 53
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 3 times the first. The third number is 4 more than the second. Find the three numbers if their sum is 53.

</div>
		<div>First number: x = 7
</div>
		<div>Third number: 3x + 4 = 24
</div>
		<div>Second number: 3x = 21
</div>
		<div>x = 7
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE D
</div>
		<div>18, 12
</div>
		<div>The larger of two numbers is 6 times the smaller.  Find each number if their sum is 42.

</div>
		<div>6, 36
</div>
		<div>6, 42
</div>
		<div>7, 42
</div>
		<div>The problem says the sum of the two numbers is 42, so one of the numbers cannot be 42. 
</div>
		<div>The larger of two numbers is 6 times the smaller.  Find each number if their sum is 42.
</div>
		<div>Be careful as you check your answer.
You're correct that the smaller number = 6,
but the larger number is 6 times the smaller.
</div>
		<div>Be careful as you represent the other number 
in terms of the variable. The larger of two 
numbers is 6 times the smaller or x = 6y.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE E
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 2 times the first.  The third is 3 more than the second.  Find the 3 numbers if their sum is 28.

</div>
		<div>5, 10, 13
</div>
		<div>7, 14, 15
</div>
		<div>3, 6, 9
</div>
		<div>None
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 2 times the first.
 y = 2xThe third is 3 more than the second.
z = 3 + 2xFind the three numbers if their sum is 28.
x + y + z = 28</div>
		<div>3, 6, and 9 almost fit, but 3 + 6 + 9 = 18, not 28. 
Be careful as you represent the variables 
and set up the equation.
</div>
		<div>The second of three numbers is 2 times the first.  The third is 3 more than the second.  Find the 3 numbers if their sum is 28.
</div>
		<div>The correct solution is there! Represent your variables, set up the equation, and then solve.
