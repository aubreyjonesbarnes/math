		<div>A LEVER is a simple machine that can move, lift, smash, or throw something.

</div>
		<div>Lever</div>
		<div>Definition of a Lever
</div>
		<div>Stiff bar or rod</div>
		<div>There are two parts to a lever:
1. A stiff bar or rod
</div>
		<div>Fulcrum</div>
		<div>2. A fulcrum (a point on which the rod can move or 
    pivot)
</div>
		<div>Levers work when someone or something applies force to one end to move a load 
on the other end.
</div>
		<div>Examples:

Levers work in different ways. A lever can be long, short, or medium sized. The fulcrum can be located in several places in relation to the load. Here are some examples of common levers.   

</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE
</div>
		<div>This can be done by: 
</div>
		<div>The Secret of Levers</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>2.  When you place a lever over a fulcrum to lift 
     something heavy, you can lift the load if you can 
     get your side to balance the other.
</div>
		<div>1.  Both sides must be equal.</div>
		<div>The following is the secret of levers: </div>
		<div>•  Increasing the force on your side or</div>
		<div>Levers can help people multiply their strength. But how can you know if you can lift or move something with a lever? 

</div>
		<div>•  Increasing the distance from the fulcrum on your side
</div>
		<div>SECRET OF LEV
</div>
		<div>There is a way to tell.</div>
		<div>•  Or both.</div>
		<div>Example:

The little kid in the drawing below is trying to lift the big kid.
</div>
		<div>He can’t do it, because there is too much weight (force) on the big kid’s side. </div>
		<div>•  Or both</div>
		<div>or</div>
		<div>To lift the big kid, the little kid must make the lever balance. 

He can do this by:
</div>
		<div>•  Increasing the distance from the  
   fulcrum on his side
</div>
		<div>•  Increasing the weight on his side</div>
		<div>EXPERIMENT
</div>
		<div>The object is to keep the stick balanced.</div>
		<div>An Experiment with a Meter Stick and Levers
</div>
		<div>Make a lever out of a meter stick.
</div>
		<div>(NOTE: You won’t always be able to do 
this perfectly because sometimes the meter sticks are not accurately made or your fulcrum is not a precise point.)
</div>
		<div>Then add weights as explained shortly.
 
</div>
		<div>You can learn a lot about balancing levers by trying the following experiment. This can be done at home or in your classroom.
</div>
		<div>Step 3: Add another weight to one side of the stick. 
            (Place it on top of the other weight.) Move 
            the two weights until the stick balances. How 
            far do you have to move them to make the 
            lever balance?
</div>
		<div>distance x 2</div>
		<div>Did you notice?  When a lever is balanced, the relationship between weight and distance from the fulcrum can be expressed as equal numbers. </div>
		<div>weight x 2</div>
		<div>Step 1: Place the meter stick dead center (50 centi-
            meters) on the fulcrum and keep it there. 
</div>
		<div>Step 4: Place a third weight on top of the other two. 
            Move the weights toward the fulcrum until 
            the stick balances. How far do you have to 
            move them?
</div>
		<div>For example: If you multiply the weight on one side of the lever by 2 (or 3 or 4), you must multiply the distance on the other side by 2 (or 3 or 4).</div>
		<div>Did you notice?  When the weight (force) on one side of the lever doubles or triples, the distance from the fulcrum on the other side must double or triple accordingly.</div>
		<div>Step 2: Place weights on each end. Balance the 
            stick. It will balance if the weights are equal 
            and they are at equal distances from the 
            fulcrum.
</div>
		<div>Step 5: Play around a little. Add other weights to 
            one side or the other. What do you       
            discover?
</div>
		<div>He must move the quarters 10 centimetersfrom the fulcrum.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE A
</div>
		<div>He can leave them on end.
</div>
		<div>Curtis wants to balance this meter stick. There is 1 quarter on each of the ends. Curtis adds one more quarter to one of the ends. Where will he have to move the pile of two quarters to keep the sides balanced?

</div>
		<div>He must move two coins halfway along one arm of the meter stick.
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>Remember:

If you multiply the weight on one side of the lever by 2 (or 3 or 4), you must multiply the distance on the other side by 2 (or 3 or 4).
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>Good job!
Curtis must move two coins half way along one arm of the meter stick to keep the sides balanced.

</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B
</div>
		<div>Bart wants to play on the teeter totter with Rebecca and Lisa. Will he be able to do it?  Bart weighs 80 pounds, Rebecca weighs 40 pounds and Lisa weighs 50 pounds.



</div>
		<div>He must move two coins half way along one arm of the meter stick.
</div>
		<div>Remember:
If you multiply the weight on one side of the lever by 2 (or 3 or 4), you must multiply the distance on the other side by 2 (or 3 or 4).
</div>
		<div>Good job!

Bart can play on the teeter totter with Rebecca and Lisa if the girls move forward toward the fulcrum a little.
</div>
		<div>Very close to the piano.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE C
</div>
		<div>In the center of the crowbar.
</div>
		<div>As far as possible from the piano.
</div>
		<div>Bart plans to use a crowbar to lift a piano off his science project. He is going to use a big rock as the fulcrum. Where should he place the rock in order to make it easiest to lift the piano? 

</div>
		<div>Did you remember?  
When you place a lever over a fulcrum to lift something heavy, you can lift the load if you can get your side to balance the other. This can be done by 
     •  Increasing the force on your side or    
     •  Increasing the distance from the fulcrum on 
        your side
</div>
		<div>Good job!
In order to make it easier to lift the piano, Bart should  place the rock close to the paino so the length of the lever will be increased.

</div>
		<div>No, because small handles provide greater leverage.
</div>
		<div>Rebecca is involved in an art cutting project. She wants to cut through several sheets of paper at once. 

</div>
		<div>Yes, because the little scissors are pretty dull.
</div>
		<div>To do this she chooses a pair of large scissors with long, heavy handles instead of a tiny pair. Is this a good choice?

</div>
		<div>Yes, because the long handles of the large scissors will provide greater leverage.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE D
</div>
		<div>Did you remember?  

Long handles will provide greater leverage.

</div>
		<div>Good job!
Rebecca made a good choice because the long handles of the large scissors will provide greater leverage.
</div>
		<div>He should choose a short crowbar because it is lighter & easier to handle.</div>
		<div>Curtis should find a friend that does not do such things
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE E
</div>
		<div>He should lift the cover off with his hands</div>
		<div>Curtis’ friend Fred is trapped in a manhole.
</div>
		<div>Curtis will have to lift the heavy cover alone. 
What should he use?

</div>
		<div>A long crowbar to increase his distance from the fulcrum & give him more leverage.</div>
		<div>Did you remember?  

Longer handles will provide greater leverage.
</div>
		<div>Curtis should use a long crowbar to increase his distance from the fulcrum & give him more leverage.
</div>
		<div>They know that a lever can move a load when it is balanced.
</div>
		<div>Engineers and scientists need to know this in designing equipment. 
</div>
		<div>When you balanced the meter stick, you adjusted weights and distances to make both sides of the lever equal.
</div>
		<div>Balancing Levers

Why is it important to know how to balance a lever?

</div>
		<div>You learned that there is an equal relationship between weight (force) and distance from the fulcrum in a balanced lever.

		<div>Balancing Levers

Mathematicians express this relationship like this:

</div>
		<div>orF x D = F x D
</div>
		<div>orForce x Distance = Force x Distance

</div>
		<div>50 pounds x 6 feet = 50 pounds x 6 feet
</div>
		<div>F x D = F x D
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>NOTE:  “Footpounds” is a unit of measure. The name for force x distance is “torque.” In the examples above we would say that the girls and the teacher exerted 600 footpounds of torque. Scientists and engineers say “torque” instead of “force x distance.”
</div>
		<div>Here is how math explains balancing a teeter totter.

1. Two girls are on a teeter totter. They are of equal 
   weight. They sit at equal distances from the 
   fulcrum. The girls balance when the numbers 
   balance.

</div>
		<div>300 footpounds = 300 footpounds

</div>
		<div>He will have to sit 3 feet from the center to balance the teeter totter.
</div>
		<div>50 pounds x 6 feet  = 100 pounds x 3 feet
</div>
		<div>A teacher weighing 100 pounds climbs on one end of the teeter totter with one of the 50-pound girls who is sitting 6 feet from the center. Where will the 
teacher have to sit in order to balance?
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>Suppose both girls want to teeter with the teacher.  Where will the two children have to sit?
</div>
		<div>They will have to sit 6 feet from the center to balance the teeter totter.
</div>
		<div>600 footpounds = 600 footpounds

</div>
		<div>100 pounds x 6 feet = 100 pounds x 6 feet
</div>
		<div>100 pounds x 2 feet = ? pounds x 10 feet 

</div>
		<div>Complete the formula: F X D = F X D

		<div>A lever is made by laying a 12 foot pole on a wheel. A big kid weighing 100 pounds sits on the end of a pole 2 feet from the fulcrum. How much pressure 
will the little kid have to exert to lift the big kid?

</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 4
</div>
		<div>Answer: 100 pounds x 2 feet  = 20 pounds x 10 feet

</div>
		<div>The little kid will have to exert 20 pounds of pressure to lift the big kid.

</div>
		<div>To solve: 
 
Step 1: Multiply the two known numbers on one 
            side of the equation:  
100 x 2 = 200
</div>
		<div>Step 2: Divide that answer by the known number on 
            the other side of the equation:  
200 ÷ 10 = 20</div>
		<div>Here is another way to solve the problem:

600 pounds x 2 feet = P pounds x 10 feet
</div>
		<div>P= 20 pounds

</div>
		<div>200 footpounds = 10P

</div>
		<div>A treasure is buried in your back yard. The hole is covered by a metal plate weighing 600 pounds. You have a bar 30 feet long. There is a big rock 10 feet away from the metal plate that you can use as a fulcrum. You can’t move the rock. You and your friends can exert 100 pounds of pressure each.

What is the fewest number of equally strong kids you will need to lift the plate? 
</div>
		<div>CHALLENGE 1
</div>
		<div>Follow these steps:

•  Determine the numbers to use for force and distance. 
   The weight (force) of the metal plate is given to you.   
   You have to get the distance from the fulcrum on either 
   side by subtracting 10 feet from 30 feet (the total 
   length of the bar).

</div>
		<div>It will take 300 pounds of pressure to lift the metal cover.


</div>
		<div>6000              = ___ x 20 feet</div>
		<div>Follow these steps:

•  Find out how many pounds of pressure it will take to 
   lift the cover.

600 pounds x 10 feet = ___ x 20 feet
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>6000 ÷ 20    = 300</div>
		<div>Follow these steps:

•  Find out how many friends it takes to exert 300 
   pounds pressure. (Each friend can exert 100 pounds.)
</div>
		<div>300 ÷ 100 = 3</div>
		<div>3 is the fewest number of equally strong kids you will need to lift the plate.</div>
		<div>CHALLENGE 2
</div>
		<div>NOTE:  The unit of force in the metric system is called a “dyne.” But for now we’re keeping things simple.
</div>
		<div>10 units x 50 centimeters = 20 units x ? centimeters

</div>
		<div>You wish to balance a meter stick. On one end of the stick (50 cm from fulcrum) you place a coin weighing 10 units. You add 2 coins each weighing 10 units to the other side of the stick. How far from the fulcrum will you need to place the 2 coins? 
</div>
		<div>The two quarters would have to be placed 25 centimeters from the fulcrum.
</div>
		<div>To solve:

•  Multiply the two known numbers on one side of the  
   equation:  
10 x 50 = 500
</div>
		<div>•  Divide that answer by the known number on the other side of the equation:  
500 ÷ 20 = 25

</div>
		<div>The two kids below want to balance the teeter totter. How far from the fulcrum will the 80 pound kid have to sit if the 40 pound kid sits on the end? 
</div>
		<div>80 pounds x  ?  feet = 40 pounds x 8 feet 

</div>
		<div>CHALLENGE 3
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>To solve:

•  Multiply the known numbers on one side:  
40 x 8 = 320
</div>
		<div>The 80-pound kid would have to sit 4 feet from the fulcrum.
</div>
		<div>•  Divide that total by the known number on the other side:  
320 ÷ 80 = 4</div>
		<div>A Lever Called a Balance 

A balance works like a lever.

</div>
		<div>How many pounds of sugar must be added to the other side to balance it?

</div>
		<div>Somebody puts 5 pounds of sugar on one side of the balance. 
</div>
		<div>Suppose a balance has a lever that is 1 foot long, with a fulcrum exactly in the center.
</div>
		<div>A Lever Called a Balance 

A balance works like a lever. Suppose a balance has a lever that is 1 foot long, with a fulcrum exactly in the center. Somebody puts 5 pounds of sugar on one 
side of the balance. How many pounds of sugar must be added to the other side to balance it?

</div>
		<div>Both sides must have 5 pounds of sugar to be equal.</div>
		<div>Answer:

When the fulcrum is exactly in the center, the weight on both sides must be the same in order to balance. In this problem the lever extends one-half foot—the same distance on either side.  
</div>
		<div>CHALLENGE 4
</div>
		<div>Problem: One clown stands on the lever. It will take 600 footpounds to propel him to the top of the pyramid. The clown on the ladder can exert a force of 200 pounds when he jumps from the ladder. How far from the fulcrum must he land in order to make the performance a success?

</div>
		<div>These clowns are ready to do a great act. When one clown jumps from a ladder onto the lever, he will  propel the other clown up into the air and onto a pyramid.

</div>
		<div>The clown on the ladder will have to land 3 feet from the fulcrum.
</div>
		<div>To Solve:

This problem is just a little different because you don’t need to worry about the clown’s weight, just the amount of footpounds needed to lift him in the air.  The equation looks like this:  
600 footpounds = 200 pounds x  ?  feet

</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>•  Divide the product on the known side by the known 
   number on the other side. 
600 ÷ 200 = 3

		<div>When you use a shovel, the hand closest to the blade becomes the fulcrum. A shovel full of dirt weighs 15 pounds. You grip the handle of the shovel 2 feet from the blade. How many pounds of force must you exert on the other end of the shovel if it is 3 feet away from your fulcrum hand? Would it be easier to lift the load of dirt if you move your fulcrum hand closer or farther away from the blade?

</div>
		<div>CHALLENGE 5
</div>
		<div>It would require 10 pounds of force to lift the load. It would be harder to lift the load if you moved your fulcrum hand away from the load. (Try another equation to check this.)</div>
		<div>•  Solve using the equation:  30  =  3 • x</div>
		<div>To Solve:

•  Set up the equation: 15 pounds x 2 feet = 3 feet • x
</div>
		<div>30 ÷ 3 = 10 = x</div>
		<div>2.  A lever has two parts:  
     • A stiff bar or rod
     • A fulcrum
</div>
		<div>3. In order to move or lift a load on one side of the 
    fulcrum, the other side must be equal. This can be   
    done by:
</div>
		<div>• increasing the force
• increasing the distance between the fulcrum and the 
force• or increasing both at the same time.
