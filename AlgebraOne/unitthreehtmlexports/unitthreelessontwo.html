		<div>Raul Plants a Garden

Raul is planting a garden.

</div>
		<div>First, he is going to put a fence up to keep animals out, especially Flopsie.
</div>
		<div>The garden will be rectangular with an area of 288 feet. One side will be 12 feet long.
</div>
		<div>Raul needs to find out how long his fence pieces will be.
</div>
		<div>Raul learns that the formula for the area of a rectangle is A = lw (Area = Length x Width.)
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>A = length x width = l x w
    288 =     12    x     w
</div>
		<div>He knows his area is 288 square feet and the length is 12 feet.  All he has to do now is find the width.
</div>
		<div>Raul remembers that to solve an equation he must do the same operation to both sides of the equal sign.
</div>
		<div>He also remembers that addition and subtraction undo each other.  Maybe. . .
</div>
		<div>He finds the width is 24 feet by dividing both sides by 12.</div>
		<div>He can solve 288 = 12x by dividing both sides by 12 because division “undoes” multiplication.
</div>
		<div>The Multiplication Property for Equations states that
 for all numbers a, b, and c,</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>if a = b, then ac = bc.

if 3 = 3, then 3 • 4 = 3 • 4
</div>

		<div>The Multiplication Property for Equations

Multiplying by a non-zero number on both sides of an equation turns it into an equivalent equation.
</div>
		<div>Also remember that division undoes multiplication.

To solve a multiplication equation, divide both sides by the variable’s coefficient.</div>
		<div>To solve an equation, the variable must end up positive.

		<div>This is what Raul did.
</div>
		<div>• 288 ÷ 12 = 24 and 12 ÷ 12 = 1.</div>

		<div>Find the value of t.

</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>Remember to multiply both sides of the 
equation by the reciprocal of 8.
</div>
		<div>8t = 32
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>Raul Plants Seeds

Raul is going to put 3 carrot seeds in each hole in the ground.
</div>
		<div>. . . will tell Raul how many holes he must dig in his garden.  The letter “h” stands for the number of holes.</div>
		<div>3h = 129</div>
		<div>He has 129 carrot seeds.  The equation. . .

equation by the reciprocal of 3.

		<div>Raul also wants to plant tomatoes in his garden.</div>
		<div>He has 150 tomato seeds and wants to plant 5 seeds in each hole. He needs to know how many holes to dig for his plants.</div>
		<div>Let h = the number of holes he needs to dig</div>
		<div>5h = 150</div>
		<div>He knows that five seeds times the number of holes will equal 150 total seeds.</div>
		<div>h = 30</div>
		<div>5h = 150
  5         5
</div>
		<div>___</div>
		<div>If he divides both sides of the equation by 5, he will know how many holes to dig.</div>
		<div>Dividing by a Non-Zero Number

Dividing by a non-zero number on both sides of an equation turns it into an equivalent equation.

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0. (Division by zero is not possible in math.) Many equations have rational number solutions.

		<div>MISC DIS
</div>
		<div>Raul knows that Floppsie, the rabbit has eaten – of his carrots. He saw that she had eaten 36 carrots.
</div>
		<div>Raul is stuck. He can’t stop Flopsie from eating his plants and can’t figure out how to solve the equation. . .
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40PAGE 45DONE</div>
		<div>Raul remembers that he must divide to solve a multiplication equation and multiply to solve a division equation.
</div>
		<div>To divide by a fraction you multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction. A reciprocal of a number is the number that when multiplied with the given number, the answer is 1.  The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2; of 3/4 is 4/3.
</div>
		<div>To solve – c = 36, divide each side by –  .
</div>
		<div>–  c</div>
		<div>•</div>
		<div>We can do this by dividing both sides by 2/3.</div>
		<div>Raul tries to divide each side by 2/3. Remember we are trying to get the “c” all by itself on one side of the equation.
</div>
		<div>÷</div>
		<div>But how can he do the rest of the problem? Find out with the next rule!</div>
