		<div>Unit 3 Lesson 3.1
The Addition Property for Equations</div>
		<div>Open Sentences

An open sentence is any algebraic sentence that contains one or more variables. It is neither true nor false. In the following example, “x” is the variable.</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>10 = 10  •  true</div>
		<div>3(2) + 4 = 10</div>
		<div>We need to solve for x in order for the algebraic sentence to be true. In this example, the replacement for x is 2.</div>
		<div>Replacing Variables with Numbers

Once a replacement is made for each variable,  
</div>
		<div>the truth of the new statement can be determined.</div>
		<div>6 + 4 = 10</div>
		<div>Solutions to Equations

A solution to an equation is any number replacement of the variable(s) which makes an open sentence a true statement. In this example, the 2 is the solution because it makes the open sentence a true statement.

</div>
		<div>m + 0 = m  •   always true
</div>
		<div>Identities

Some algebraic sentences are true for every replacement of the variable(s). These are called identities.

</div>
		<div>Empty Sets

For some algebraic sentences, no value of the variable makes them true. Their solution is the empty set.  In this example x • 0 is not equal to 3; because x • 0 = 0.
</div>
		<div>3
0
</div>
		<div>–    = x        • empty set (no solution) 
                          because x • 0 ≠ 3.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>30 + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>20 = 32</div>
		<div>6(5) + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>6(3) + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>false</div>
		<div>32 = 32</div>
		<div>18 + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>6(5) + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>30 + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>Let’s check to see if 3 or 5 is the solution of this sentence:
</div>
		<div>Therefore, 5 is the solution of 6x + 2 = 32 since it makes the statement true.</div>
		<div>Let’s check to see if 3 or 5 is the solution of this sentence:
</div>
		<div>6x + 2 = 32
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>true</div>
		<div>6(3) + 2 = 32</div>
		<div>Therefore, -3 is the solution.</div>
		<div>18 + 4 = 3 + 14
</div>
		<div>18 - 2(2) = 3 - 7(2)</div>
		<div>18 + 6 = 3 + 21</div>
		<div>Let’s find out which of the numbers, -2, 2, or -3, is a solution of this sentence:
</div>
		<div>18 - 4 = 3 - 14</div>
		<div>18 - 2m = 3 - 7m
</div>
		<div>18 - 2(2) = 3 - 7(2)</div>
		<div>Let’s find out which of the numbers, -2, 2, or -3, is a solution of this sentence:
</div>
		<div>18 - 2(-2) = 3 - 7(-2)
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>14 = -11</div>
		<div>18 - 2m = 3 - 7m
</div>
		<div>18 + 4 = 3 + 14
</div>
		<div>18 - 2(-3) = 3 - 7(-3)</div>
		<div>18 - 4 = 3 - 14</div>
		<div>24 = 24</div>
		<div>18 + 6 = 3 + 21</div>
		<div>Let’s find out which of the numbers, -2, 2, or -3, is a solution of this sentence:
</div>
		<div>Therefore, 2 is not a solution.</div>
		<div>22 = 17
</div>
		<div>18 - 2(-2) = 3 - 7(-2)
</div>
		<div>Therefore, -2 is not a solution.</div>
		<div>18 - 2(-3) = 3 - 7(-3)</div>
		<div>PRACTICE A
</div>
		<div>Which, if either, of the numbers, 2 or -3, is a solution of the following?

</div>
		<div>-3</div>
		<div>5x - 6 = 7x</div>
		<div>both
</div>
		<div>2
</div>
		<div>neither
</div>
		<div>5x - 6 = 7x
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>You must have miscalculated.  
Substitute each variable into the equation 
to see if a true statement is made.
</div>
		<div>2 and -3 are not both solutions.  
Substitute each variable into the equation 
to see which one makes it a true statement.
</div>
		<div>There is a solution to this equation!  
Substitute each variable into the equation 
to see which one makes it a true statement.
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>1
</div>
		<div>-6</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B
</div>
		<div>Which of the numbers, -6, -2, or 1, is a solution of the following?

</div>
		<div>2 - 3x = 5x - 6</div>
		<div>-2</div>
		<div>2 - 3x = 5x - 6
</div>
		<div>You must have miscalculated. -6 is not a solution. Substitute the remaining variables into the equation to see which one makes it a true statement.
</div>
		<div>You must have miscalculated. -2 is not a solution. Substitute the remaining variables into the equation to see which one makes it a true statement.
</div>
		<div>RULE 2
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>A Balanced Equation</div>
		<div>This balance represents an equation.

</div>
		<div>An equation has an equal sign with two equal sides. </div>
		<div>Equations
</div>
		<div>An equation is a mathematical sentence made up of two expressions connected by the “equals” symbol, “=.”
</div>
		<div>These are examples of equations.
</div>
		<div>4 + 5(a + 6) = (a - 7)9 - a</div>
		<div>6 = 2 + 4
</div>
		<div>2a + 5 = 7(a - 5)</div>
		<div>Adding a number to both sides of an equation transforms it into an equivalent equation.</div>
		<div>2a = 12</div>
		<div>Equivalent Equations
</div>
		<div>3 + 2a = 12 + 3</div>
		<div>Equivalent equations are equations that have the same solution. 
</div>
		<div>This is true because the Addition Property for Equations states, for all numbers a, b, and c, </div>
		<div>if a = b, then a + c = b + c. </div>
		<div>2a - 3 = 12 + (-3)</div>
		<div>Subtracting a number from both sides of an equation also transforms it into an equivalent equation, since subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite.
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>• The result is true.</div>
		<div>7 = 5 + 2  
</div>
		<div>• Addition Property
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 3
</div>
		<div>7 + 8 = 5 + 2 + 8</div>
		<div>These are examples of equivalent equations.
</div>
		<div>7 + 8 = 5 + 2 + 8</div>
		<div>• True</div>
		<div>15 = 15  </div>
		<div>10 = 10</div>
		<div>x + 4 = 10
</div>
		<div>x = 6
</div>
		<div>• Substitute for x.</div>
		<div>x + 4 = 6 + 4
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 4
</div>
		<div>x + 4 = 6 + 4
</div>
		<div>6 + 4 = 10</div>
		<div>• The solution is 6.</div>
		<div>• Addition Property
</div>
		<div>• The solution is still 6.</div>
		<div>Here is another pair of equivalent equations.
</div>
		<div>How much does the rock weigh?

</div>
		<div>RULE 3
</div>
		<div>No, the rock does not equal six pounds. If it were six pounds, the scale would be balanced.</div>
		<div>Rock</div>
		<div>Weights</div>
		<div>If each weight equals one pound, does the rock weigh 7 pounds? In other words, is the scale balanced?
</div>
		<div>In order for the rock to equal 7 pounds, the scale would have to be balanced like this one.

</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>Is the rock equal to 6 pounds?

</div>
		<div>No, the scale is not balanced yet. If the rock was balanced with the weights, then it would equal them.</div>
		<div>Yes.  Since the scale is balanced, the rock equals 4 pounds. 

</div>
		<div>Does the rock equal 4 pounds?

</div>
		<div>The balancing of the scale is similar to the balancing of an equation.

</div>
		<div>To solve an equation, the variable must be by itself on one side of the equation.</div>
		<div>Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must also do it to the other side to keep it balanced.

</div>
		<div>x + 4</div>
		<div>11</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>Remember, you must do the same things to both sides to keep the scale balanced.</div>
		<div>Hey! 
I must weigh 7 pounds.
</div>
		<div>A total of 4 pounds were removed in order for the balance to be equal.</div>
		<div>x + 4 - 4</div>
		<div>______________</div>
		<div>x + 4 = 11</div>
		<div>x = 7</div>
		<div>11 - 4</div>
		<div>- 4     - 4</div>
		<div>“Undoing” an Operation
</div>
		<div>NOTE
</div>
		<div>In science, many operations undo one another. For example, melting “undoes” freezing. Likewise, freezing “undoes” melting.

</div>
		<div>Inverse Operations
</div>
		<div>Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. This means that one operation “undoes” the other 

and your answer/equation doesn't change.</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>Walking 10 steps west will “undo” walking 10 steps east.

</div>
		<div>To solve an equation of the form x + a = b, use the additive inverse property and the addition property for equations to “get x alone on one side of the equation.”
</div>
		<div>Solving Equations

</div>
		<div>3 + 8 = x - 8 + 8</div>
		<div>11 = x</div>
		<div>• Simplify.</div>
		<div>• We need to eliminate the -8 to have x alone. Adding 8 to -8
 will “undo” the -8, so that x is
 alone.
</div>
		<div>Solve for x:  3 = x - 8
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 5
</div>
		<div>11 = x + 0</div>
		<div>3 = x - 8</div>
		<div>• x is alone.</div>
		<div>• Add 8 to each side. We must do exactly the same to both sides so that it remains equal to the original equation.</div>
		<div>11 = x + 0</div>
		<div>3 = 3</div>
		<div>3 = 11 - 8</div>
		<div>11 = x</div>
		<div>3 = 11 - 8</div>
		<div>3 = x - 8
</div>
		<div>3 + 8 = x - 8 + 8</div>
		<div>Solve. Check by substituting the 11 in the original equation for x to find out if x really does equal 11.
</div>
		<div>3 = x - 8 </div>
		<div>3 = x - 8 </div>
		<div>(A true statement so 
x = 11 is the solution.)
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 6
</div>
		<div>x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5</div>
		<div>x + 0 = 4</div>
		<div>x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5</div>
		<div>Solve for x in x + 5 = 9. 
</div>
		<div>x = 4</div>
		<div>•  Simplify.</div>
		<div> x + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>• We need to eliminate the 5 
to have x alone.
</div>
		<div>•  x is alone.</div>
		<div>• Add -5 to each side.</div>
		<div>x = 4</div>
		<div>(A true statement so 
x = 4 is the solution.)
</div>
		<div>Solve. Does x really equal 4?  Check by substituting 4 for x in the original equation.
</div>
		<div>x + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>x + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>x + 0 = 4</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35DONE</div>
		<div>4 + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>4 + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>9 = 9
</div>
		<div>x + 5 = 9</div>
		<div>x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5</div>
		<div>x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
</div>
		<div>x = 4</div>
		<div>• Simplify.</div>
		<div>• We need to eliminate the 5 
to have x alone.
</div>
		<div>In solving an equation of the form x + a = b, transform it into a basic equation, x = c, (to find out what x is) by adding (or subtracting) the same quantity on both sides.
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 7
</div>
		<div>x + 0 = 4
</div>
		<div>• Add -5 to each side.
</div>
		<div>• x is alone.</div>
		<div>x + 5 = 9
</div>
		<div>Solve. Check the solution.
