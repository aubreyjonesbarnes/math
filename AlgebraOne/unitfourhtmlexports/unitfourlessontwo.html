		<div>Polynomials:
Classifying and Simplifying
</div>
		<div>Unit 4: Enter Title for Unit 4</div>
		<div>Mr. Soto decided to buy some land and build a house.
</div>
		<div>Suppose Mr. Soto's house is 2 stories with 3 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms.
</div>
		<div>2 stories</div>
		<div>Let's call it 2 (for the 2 stories)
</div>
		<div>Let's call it 2b3 (for the 3 bathrooms)
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40DONE</div>
		<div>Let's call it 2b3r4 (for the 4 bedrooms)
</div>
		<div>One house composed of 2 stories, 3 bathrooms, and 4 bedrooms.</div>
		<div>2b3r4 is a monomial.  Even though it is composed of constants and variables, it is one product.
</div>
		<div>Mr. Banales liked Mr. Soto's house and location, so he decided to build a house next to it.
</div>
		<div>Let's label Mr. Banales' house b2r3 because it has one story, two bathrooms, and three bedrooms.
</div>
		<div>One house composed of 1 story, 2 bathrooms, and 3 bedrooms.</div>
		<div>b2r3 is also a monomial since it is the product of two variables.
</div>
		<div>RULE 1
</div>
		<div>A monomial is a term that is either a constant, a variable, or a product of a constant and one or more variables.
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40DONE</div>
		<div>3) –x4 is a constant and a variable</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 1
</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 2
</div>
		<div>2) x is a variable</div>
		<div>The following are types of monomials.
</div>
		<div>4) -6a2bc3 is a product of a constant and 
    several variables.
</div>
		<div>1) 17 is a constant</div>

		<div>Which of the following is a monomial?

</div>
		<div>x - y
</div>
		<div>4x +y
</div>
		<div>        + a
</div>
		<div>_</div>
		<div>QUESTION 1
</div>
		<div>The rule says monomials can be the product of constants and variables.  Remember that a product is the multiplication of constants and variables.
</div>
		<div>Try Again</div>
		<div>While – is a constant, you are adding it to "a".  The rule states you must have a product.

		<div>QUESTION 2
</div>
		<div>a2 + b
</div>
		<div>abc
</div>
		<div>a + bc
</div>
		<div>2a + 3b + 4
</div>
		<div>A monomial must be a product of a constant and a variable.  a + bc and a2 + b involve the addition of different variables.  They are both binomials.
</div>
		<div>A monomial must be a product of a constant and a variable.  2a + 3b + 4 is the sum of three terms 
and is thus a trinomial.
</div>
		<div>A monomial must be a product of a constant and a variable.  a + bc and a2 + b involve the addition of different variables.  They are both binomials.
</div>
		<div>There are 7 rooms (bathrooms and bedrooms) in Mr. Soto's house.
</div>
		<div>RULE 2
</div>
		<div>There are 5 rooms (bathrooms and bedrooms) in Mr. Banales' house.</div>
		<div>b2r3
degree = 2 + 3 = 5

		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40DONE</div>
		<div>2b3r4
degree = 3 + 4 = 7
</div>
		<div>The degree of a monomial is determined by finding the sum of the exponents of the variable in the monomial. 
</div>
		<div>0
no degree

</div>
		<div>A non-zero constant has a degree of 0 and the constant of 0 has no degree.
</div>
		<div>2b3r4
degree = 0 + 3 + 4 = 7

</div>
		<div>degree: 0 + 3 = 3</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 5
</div>
		<div>Find the degree of each monomial.

		<div>11y3</div>
		<div>11y3</div>
		<div>EXAMPLE 6

		<div>4x2y3

		<div>PRACTICE A
</div>
		<div>3
</div>
		<div>13
</div>
		<div>Find the degree of each monomial:

</div>
		<div>11xy2</div>
		<div>0
</div>
		<div>The rule notes that only a nonzero constant 
has a degree of zero.  But there are also 
variables in this monomial.
</div>
		<div>Remember, a variable by itself such as y has a degree of 1and a constant has a degree of 0.  To find the degree of the monomial add all the exponents.
</div>
		<div>Remember to add the exponents not the numbers.
</div>
		<div>0</div>
		<div>19</div>
		<div>19
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE B
</div>
		<div>Remember that a nonzero constant 
has a degree of zero.

		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40DONE</div>
		<div>Mr. Soto's and Mr. Banales' house are the only ones on the block.
</div>
		<div>2b3r4 + b2r3 describes all the houses on the block.
</div>
		<div>2b3r4 + b2r3 = the block</div>
		<div>Think of the polynomial as a block. A block is the sum of the houses in it.
</div>
		<div>A polynomial is either a monomial or the sum or difference of two or more monomials.
</div>
		<div>"Poly" in the word polynomial means "more than one".
</div>
		<div>RULE 4
</div>
		<div>"Bi" means two, so binomial means two terms.

            2b3r4 + b2r3
</div>
		<div>"Mono" means one, so monomial means a polynomial with one term.

            2b3r4 
</div>
		<div>"Tri" means three, so trinomial means three terms.

            2b3r4 + b2r3 + 2
</div>
		<div>PAGE 0PAGE 5PAGE 10PAGE 15PAGE 20PAGE 25PAGE 30PAGE 35PAGE 40DONE</div>
		<div>Polynomials with one, two, or three terms have special names:
</div>
		<div>4xy + 2z
</div>
		<div>x2 + y2 + 3z
</div>
		<div>Which of the following is a binomial?

</div>
		<div>2x3y2
</div>
		<div>QUESTION 3
</div>
		<div>ab
</div>
		<div>ab and 2x3y2z are both monomials.
</div>
		<div>x2 + y2 + 3z has three terms.
It is a trinomial.
</div>
		<div>Which of the following is a trinomial?

</div>
		<div>QUESTION 4
</div>
		<div>a + b
</div>
		<div>x2 + 3x - 8
</div>
		<div>2a2bc
</div>
		<div>3x2y
</div>
		<div>That is incorrect.
a + b is a binomial because it has two terms.
</div>
		<div>2a2bc and 3x2y are both monomials because each is only one term.
</div>
		<div>Label each polynomial as either a monomial, binomial, or trinomial.

		<div>3x2 + 2x - 6</div>
		<div>trinomial
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE E
</div>
		<div>binomial</div>
		<div>Remember, a monomial is only one term that is either a constant, a variable, or a product of a constant and one or more variables.
</div>
		<div>Remember, a binomial is a polynomial with two terms such as 5x - 7.
</div>
		<div>PRACTICE F
</div>
		<div>xy2 + 2x
</div>
		<div>Remember, a monomial is a polynomial with one term such as 5x.

		<div>Remember the degree of a polynomial is the greatest degree of an individual term.
</div>
		<div>x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1
</div>
		<div>This is not the highest exponent.  The coefficient is not part of the degree.
